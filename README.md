# PlatformerGame
During programming I learned C # and also needed to understand how the Unity engine works and what functions it provides. I spent a lot of time creating animations with 2D sprites, AI for enemies, in-game store, and also created three bosses, three levels and it's worth mentioning that the player can choose 3 heroes for the game. Although this game took me a month, I learned a lot on the other hand, how to work with animations, how artificial intelligence should work, i.e. when you create a game, you do a few different jobs at once, not related to programming, thanks to which I had the opportunity to learn something new in other directions

Create a new project in Unity, after this to move a folder Asset to the project.
